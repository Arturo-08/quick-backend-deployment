# Quick Backend Deployment üöÄ

This repository contains a very simple backend, ideal as a starting point for more complex projects. It includes a single `/health` endpoint that returns a basic response to verify the service is up and running.

## ‚ú® Features

- Minimal backend with a `/health` endpoint  
- Automated deployment to AWS EC2 instances using:
  - Docker  
  - GitHub Actions  
  - GitHub Package Registry  
- Simple and scalable CI/CD workflow

##üñ•Ô∏è AWS Requirements
- EC2 with docker, docker compose installed.
- AWS credentials with EC2FullAccess policy.
- Set inbound rules to allow Http, Https and SSH trafic.

> It's important to keep this structure so GitHub Actions can correctly detect and run the CI/CD workflows.

## üîê Environment Configuration

For security, you must create an *Environment* inside the repository (e.g., `DEV`) and store all required secrets there, such as:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`  
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  
- `EC2_PRIVATE_KEY`  
- `GH_TOKEN` (if needed)  
- Other environment variables like `EC2_HOST`, `IMAGE_NAME`, `SERVER_PORT`, `JWT_TOKEN`, etc.

Also, remeber to configure the permissions of your github actions:

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Set up **branch protection rules** to avoid direct pushes to `main`.  
- Review and restrict who can approve and merge pull requests.  
- Create a separate environment for production (`PROD`) with similar security settings.  
- Add **unit test checks** before building and pushing the Docker image.

## üß™ Test Endpoint

You can verify that the backend is running correctly using the following endpoint:
GET /health

Expected output:
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-05-20T17:25:33.908210700Z",
    "status": 200,
    "message": "Petici√≥n exitosa",
    "data": "Backend is running perfectly."
}
